Featuring creative hand-drawn animations throughout,  a minimal layout, nice use of grey & strong call-to-action. \n\n> We are Finn Ericson and Eran Hilleli. United by a complimentary skillset we both share the love for the visual, audio and code. Inspired by musical instruments and early video games we set out to create meaningful and playful experiences for all ages with a hearty focus on creativity.\n\n[Check them out](https://iorama.studio/)!\n\n<img src=\"/images/uploads/iorama-studio2.jpg\" class=\"full-image\" alt=\"Iorama Studio Website\">",
