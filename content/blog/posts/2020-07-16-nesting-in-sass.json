Which is why it has a tendency to become disorganized quite quickly. \n\nEnter Sass **nesting**!\n\n## Definition\n\nUsing nesting, we can nest child selectors inside of the parent selector.\n\nThis results in much cleaner and less repetitive code.\n\n## Example\n\nTake the following HTML:\n\n```HTML\n<nav class=\"navbar\">\n  <ul>\n    <li>Home</li>\n    <li>Store</li>\n    <li>Contact Us</li>\n  </ul>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUsing regular CSS, we would write this like so:\n\n```css\n.navbar {\n  background-color: orangered;\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n.navbar ul {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.navbar li {\n  text-align: center;\n  margin: 1rem;\n}\n```\n\nThere’s a lot of repetition here. Each time we want to style a child of `navbar`, we have to repeat the class name.\n\nWith Sass nesting, we can write much cleaner code.\n\nLike so:\n\n```sass\n.navbar {\n  background-color: orangered;\n  padding: 1rem;\n  ul {\n    list-style: none;\n  }\n  li {\n    text-align: center;\n    margin: 1rem;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing indentation, you can now see the `ul` and `li` selectors are neatly nested inside the `navbar` selector.\n\nWe have a much less repetitive syntax, which is far easier to read! \n\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n* [An Introduction to SASS](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-07-07-an-introduction-to-sass)\n* [Setting up SASS](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-07-09-setting-up-sass)\n* [Using SASS Variables](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-07-14-using-sass-variables)",
