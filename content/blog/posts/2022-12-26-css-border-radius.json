  "body": "The CSS `border-radius` property defines the radius of an element's corners. We can use this property to add rounded corners to our elements! It’s often used for buttons, images, and more advanced CSS shapes. Let’s dive a little further into this useful property…\n\nTypically, `border-radius` takes from one to four values, and the order in which the values are specified determines which corner each value applies to.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\n.my-element {\n  border-radius: 15px 50px 30px 5px;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the values are applied to each order in the following order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left.\n\nThis would give the top-left corner a radius of 15px, the top-right corner a radius of 50px, the bottom-right corner a radius of 30px, and the bottom-left corner a radius of 5px.\n\nYou can also specify the radius for each corner individually, using the following properties:\n\n* `border-top-left-radius`\n* `border-top-right-radius`\n* `border-bottom-right-radius`\n* `border-bottom-left-radius`\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n.my-element {\n  border-top-left-radius: 15px;\n  border-top-right-radius: 50px;\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 30px;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThis would achieve the same result as the previous example.\n\nThe `border-radius` property is actually a shorthand property for the `border-top-left-radius`, `border-top-right-radius`, `border-bottom-right-radius` and `border-bottom-left-radius` properties.\n\n#### Creating shapes with border-radius\n\nYou can also use the `border-radius` property to create shapes such as circles or ellipses.\n\nTo create a circle, set the radius to a value that is equal to or larger than the width or height of the element. For example:\n\n```\n.my-circle {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  border-radius: 50%; /* radius equal to half the width and height of the element */\n}\n```\n\nThis would create a circle with a radius of 50px as the radius is set to half the width and height of the element.\n\nYou can also use the `border-radius` property to create elliptical shapes by setting differing values for the horizontal and vertical radius. For example:\n\n```\n.my-ellipse {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 100px;\n  border-radius: 50%/25%; /* horizontal radius of 50% and vertical radius of 25% */\n}\n```\n\nThis would create an ellipse with a horizontal radius of 100px (50% of the width) and a vertical radius of 25px (25% of the height).\n\nI hope this tutorial has helped you understand how to use the `border-radius` property in CSS.\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n* [Basic Selectors](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-03-10-css-basic-selectors)\n* [Pseudo-Classes](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-03-31-css-pseudo-classes)\n* [Pseudo-Elements](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-04-06-css-pseudo-elements)",
