  "body": "Before we can write Sass code, it needs to be installed locally. As by default, it’s not a language known to the browser.\n\nLet’s now go through the process to setup the Sass environment! So we can then write then compile our own Sass code.\n\n*Note:* When Sass is compiled, it is converted into regular CSS code that browsers can interpret and render.\n\n## Environment Setup\n\nBefore we start, you must have **npm** installed on your computer, it comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/); you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Go ahead and install it if you haven’t already.\n\nIf you are unsure whether you have Node.js installed or not, run `node -v` from your terminal.\n\nIf you see a version number, it’s installed!\n\n*A note on terminal:*\n\nIf you are new to SASS, chances are you may also be new to running commands from the terminal. It’s not as daunting as it might seem! And it’s a real time-saver once you gain more experience.\n\nTo open a terminal on a Windows PC, right-click the Windows Icon and select *Windows Powershell*, if you’re on a Mac go to *Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal*.\n\n## Folder Structure\n\nLet’s create our project folders! They will be structured like so:\n\n```SASS\nsass-project\n   |- sass\n   |- css\n```\n\nTo create this structure, open terminal and change to the folder you wish to install the sass project into (via the cd command).\n\nThen run the following commands:\n\n```\nmkdir sass-project\ncd sass-project\nmkdir -p sass css\n```\n\n## File Structure\n\nYou will need an *index.html* and *main.scss* in this folder.\n\nTo create these files, run:\n\n```\ntouch index.html\ncd sass\ntouch main.scss\ncd ..\n```\n\nYou’ll also need a default CSS stylesheet for the SASS to compile into:\n\n```\ncd css\ntouch style.css\n```\n\nOpen up your *index.html* and paste in the following code:\n\n```HTML\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Index page</title>\n    <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”css/style.css”>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n \n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is just our boilerplate code with the stylesheet connected!\n\n\n\n## Initializing our Project Directory\n\nAll projects that use npm need to be initialized. To do this, ensure you’re still in the sass-project folder and run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nThis will create a **package.json** file for our project. We’ll be learning more about the configuration of this file later in the course!\n\n## Install node-sass\n\n**node-sass** is the library which allows us to compile `.scss` to `.css`.\n\nRun the following command to install node-sass as *dev dependency*.\n\n```\nnpm install node-sass --save-dev\n```\n\n*Note:* A **dev dependency** is only used in the build phase of our project. It’s not included at runtime.\n\n## Compiling Sass Code to CSS\n\nNext, we need to create an *npm script* to run the compilation.\n\nAdd this script inside the script section of our previously created **package.json** file:\n\n```\n\"compile-sass\": \"node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css\"\n```\n\n*Don’t forget to separate each script with a comma!*\n\nWe have here specified **main.scss** as our main Sass file and **style.css** as the compiled CSS file.\n\nTo compile our SASS code into CSS, all we need to do is run:\n\n```\nnpm run compile-sass\n```\n\n## Live Reload\n\nLet’s also add a live reload to our project! To do this run the following to install globally:\n\n```\nnpm install live-server -g\n```\n\nNow, make sure you’re still in the Sass project folder, and run:\n\n```\nlive-server\n```\n\nAnd just like that, you’ve got a pretty neat dev environment with your project running locally on HTTP.\n\nYou’ll need to keep `live-server` and `npm run compile-sass` running in two separate terminal windows.\n\nSo we now have the project environment all set up on the local machine!\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n* [Introduction to SASS](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-07-07-an-introduction-to-sass)",
