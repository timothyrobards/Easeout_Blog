  "body": "CSS Vendor prefixes (or browser prefixes) are a way for browsers to give access to new CSS features not yet considered stable.\n\nBy using prefixes, we can use these newer CSS features with the browsers that support them — instead of waiting for all browsers to catch up.\n\nFor example, before CSS Transitions were fully supported, you’d have added the prefixes, like so:\n\n```css\n.element {\n\t-webkit-transition: all 1s ease-out;\n\t-moz-transition: all 1s ease-out;\n\t-ms-transition: all 1s ease-out;\n\t-o-transition: all 1s ease-out;\n\ttransition: all 1s ease-out;\n}\n```\n\nThe prefixes used are:\n\n* `-webkit-` (Chrome, Safari, iOS Safari / iOS WebView, Android)\n* `-moz-` (Firefox)\n* `-ms-` (Edge, Internet Explorer)\n* `-o-` (Opera, Opera Mini)\n\nWriting prefixes has traditionally been a hassle. So projects like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) came along to automate the process, by adding any required prefixes automatically. This tool generates prefixes based on the information provided from [canIuse](https://caniuse.com/).\n\nMany modern frameworks (e.g. create-react-app, the Vue CLI & PostCSS) use autoprefixer out of the box, so remembering to add prefixes has become a thing of the past!\n\n## Is prefixing still necessary?\n\nPrefixing is a rapidly declining issue.\n\nBrowsers are getting better at supporting new features. And now, the rise of **experimental CSS** is encouraging client-side testing of new features (via local browser settings), instead of on production websites.\n\nIf you’re working without build tools on a project that needs to function on older browsers — it’s worth running your CSS through autoprefixer. Check out the handy online tool: <https://autoprefixer.github.io/>. Otherwise you can rest assured that your CSS will be supported!\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n* [CSS Transforms](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-06-10-css-transforms)\n* [CSS Transitions](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-06-19-css-transitions)\n* [Feature Queries](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-06-08-css-feature-queries)",
