We can work with addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operators.\n\nThe most useful feature of this function is the ability to mix units. For example, you could use it to subtract pixels from the viewport width:\n\n```css\n.main {   \n   height: calc(100vh - 80px); \n}\n```\n\n## Using calc\n\nThe `calc()` function only works with *values*. So youâ€™d only ever use it when expecting a pixel value.\n\nLetâ€™s take a look at some possible use cases..\n\nWe could use it to calculate the full viewport width, minus 200px accounting for a side nav:\n\n```css\ndiv {\n   max-width: calc(100vw - 200px);\n}\n```\n\nOr to put a â€˜scroll to topâ€™ button at the bottom-right corner of a page:\n\n```css\nbody {\n   background-image: url(arrow.png); \n   background-position: calc(100% - 25px) calc(100% - 25px);\n}\n```\n\nOr when working with typography:\n\n```css\n.text {\n  font-size: calc(2vw + 5px);\n  width:     calc(100% - 10px);\n  height:    calc(100vh - 20px);\n}\n```\n\nIt can also be used as a part of shorthand properties:\n\n```css\nmargin: calc(6.25% - 5px) 0;\n```\n\nUnfortunately, it doesnâ€™t work for media queries ðŸ˜¢:\n\n```css\n@media (max-width: 30rem) {\n  /* Works! */\n}\n@media (min-width: calc(30rem + 1px)) {\n  /* Doesn't work */ \n}\n```\n\nThe real power of `calc()`comes from the ability to mix units. And every example above has done just that! The ability to perform math operations when working with lengths, is a great reason to start using calc!\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n* [CSS Units](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-04-30-css-units)\n* [CSS Fonts](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-05-07-css-fonts)\n* [The Box Model](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-04-14-the-css-box-model)",
