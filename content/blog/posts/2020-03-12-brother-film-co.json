Weâ€™re a creatively-led video production company, founded by brothers.\n\nFeaturing a lovely three.js landing animation, clever microinteractions & transitions, as well as a wealth of well-situated text animations. \n\nAnd as added easter-egg, if you leave the tab open & return later, it'll have a \"Windows 95-esque\" screensaver bouncing around the browser! ðŸ†’\n\nCheck [them out](https://brotherfilmco.com/)!\n\n<img src=\"/images/uploads/brother-film-co-1.jpg\" class=\"full-image\" alt=\"Brother Film Co Landing Page\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/uploads/brother-film-co-2.png\" class=\"full-image\" alt=\"Brother Film Co Project\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/uploads/brother-film-co-3.png\" class=\"full-image\" alt=\"Brother Film Co Project\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/uploads/brother-film-co-4.jpg\" class=\"full-image\" alt=\"Brother Film Co project\">"
