It’s fair to say that most navigation menus are essentially HTML lists, which have been styled using CSS.\n\n# How to style lists with CSS\n\nCSS has several properties that we can use for styling. We can set different list item markers, use images as markers, as well as add colors & background colors.\n\nLet’s take a look at the syntax!\n\n## list-style-type\n\nWe use `list-style-type` to set a marker for our list:\n\n```css\nli {\n  list-style-type: square;\n}\n```\n\nThere are in fact a whole lot of possible values! Such as `circle`, `square`, `decimal`, `upper-roman` and `none`. See all the [list style types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type).\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that if you’re setting the color of the list marker — it’ll default to whatever the element color is.\n\nAlso, you’ll often use the `list-style-type:none` property to remove the markers completely!\n\n## list-style-position\n\nWith `list-style-position` you can position the marker `outside` (default) or `inside` of the list content:\n\n```css\nli {\n  list-style-position: outside;\n}\nli {\n  list-style-position: inside;\n}\n```\n\nWhen using `inside` with lists of text for example, each marker will be contained within the text box, thus indenting the first line of text for each list item.\n\n## list-style-image\n\n`list-style-image` can be used to place a custom image as a marker:\n\n```css\nli {\n  list-style-image: url(goldstar.png);\n}\n```\n\nThe URL points to the location of the image.\n\nIt’s good practice to also set a `list-style-type` as a fallback, in case the image is unavailable.\n\n## list-style (Shorthand)\n\nThe `list-style` shorthand property lets us specify our `list-style-type`, `list-style-position` & `list-style-image` in one declaration.\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\nul {\n list-style: square inside url(\"goldstar.png\");\n}\n```\n\nThis would be equivalent to:\n\n```css\nul {\n list-style-type: square;\n list-style-position: inside;\n list-style-image: url(goldstar.png);\n}\n```\n\nWhen using this shorthand property, be mindful of the order: `list-style-type`, then `list-style-position` and lastly `list-style-image`. If any of these properties are missing, they’ll revert to their default state.\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n* [The Box Model](https://www.easeout.co/blog/2020-04-14-the-css-box-model)",
